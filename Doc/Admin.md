## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Terminology
A Virtual World is a representation of the real world using a computer. The main components of a virtual world are very similar to the real world but they are given different names. Instead of real world Places, People, and Things, there are virtual world Rooms, NPCs, and Objects.  There is an additional and very important component needed for creating a Virtual World, imagination.

A Place is a Room, but not always a room that would be found in a house. Rooms represent any place in the world, a bedroom, street, city square, road, etc. A room does not have a size. It is given dimension only verbally in the Room Description.

People are NPCs which stands for Non Player Character, in addition to people, they are used to represent any living creature. Examples of NPCs are: sentries, guards, sheep, dogs, cats, and spiders.

A Thing is an Object. Some objects can be acquired by players, such as: a candle, waterskin, sword, pair of pants, or a helmet. Other objects can be used. A player may drink from a spring, but the spring cannot be taken. There are also objects which are just for atmosphere, such as: a statue, table, or a cart.

The last, but certainly the most important component of a successful virtual world is players. Without players, well, what's the point?

Rooms, NPCs, and Objects all have attributes that are used to make them unique. These attributes must be coded correctly in order for the Room, NPC, or Object to have the desired effect in the creation of the Virtual World. This document describes those attributes and occasionally suggests appropriate ways to use them. The following is a cross reference of virtual world terms, not all of which are used in this document. In general terms these are equivalents, but there can be distinctions such as a 'Player' usually refers to person at the keyboard and 'Character' refers to the in-game representation being controlled by the player.

| OMugs Term | Equivalent | Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Room | Place | Location |
| NPC | Mobile | Mob |
| Object | Item | Thing |
| Player | Character | Toon |

### 1.2 Creating a virtual world
A virtual world is experienced by Players. Yes, the ultra-valuable Player. Nothing of any significance happens in a virtual world without players. Once a player logs on and begins to play, their interest must be captured or else they logoff and might never return. An interesting story is a must for a successful virtual world. So, get a story or make one up. It may be helpful to assume the role of a director of a play. What are the scenes, who are the actors, and what are the props? Scenes might include towns, meeting places, forests, mountains, and places of worship. Actors in a town might include citizens of the town, guards, shopkeepers, dogs, cats, and rats. Props might include all armor, weapons, food, statues, springs, bags, and jewelry. Drawing a map and noting the location of major scenes, who is involved, and what props they might need will help ensure a memorable world for players to experience.

### 1.3 Critical virtual world components
A virtual world is made of rooms that are connected to each other. A player explores a virtual world by moving from room to room. Each room has a name, description, and exits. A room map is essential to creating a cohesive world.

NPCs are placed in rooms and may move around in the world or remain stationary. Each NPCs has a description and is given attributes like hit points and damage. Roaming NPCs will move randomly about the world, although their movement may be limited by creating rooms which do not allow NPCs.

Objects are placed in a room or given to an NPC. Players acquire objects by finding them through exploration, killing NPCs, buying them from NPC shopkeepers, or getting them from other players.

The initial state of NPCs and objects within the virtual world is defined using randomizing factors. This ensures that the same NPC and/or object does not reappear in the same place on predetermined schedule.

### 1.4 Other virtual world components
There are a several other components that make up a virtual world. First among these are the socials. Socials are used by players to communicate in a non-verbal manner with other players. These should be carefully defined so that they enhance the atmosphere of the virtual world as opposed to detracting from it. For example, a common command in virtual worlds is bow. But maybe bow does not fit the atmosphere and should be replaced with kisscheeks because in the given virtual world people do not bow, they kiss each other on the cheeks.

Help is also very important and should also fit the atmosphere of the virtual world. Help usually includes examples and this is where care must be taken to maintain the atmosphere.

### 1.5 The library
The virtual world is defined using a set of text files located in the LIBRARY directory. Each component is located within the LIBRARY directory and each component has a special format which must be followed carefully. Remember, it is a computer program that reads these files. Computer programs tend to be stupid and upon encountering something they do not understand, they either quit working or spit out some error message and then try to continue, neither of which is desirable. So, be very careful to create each file according the specifications in this document. For the most part, UPPER and lower case have no significance and anything may be typed in all UPPER case, all lower case, or Mixed Case. Mixed Case is preferred because it increases readability. The exception relates to the text displayed to the player. This text will be displayed 'as is' including spacing, line breaks, and blank lines. A prime example of this is room descriptions.

### 1.6 The library files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \Library\Doors\<RoomId><RoomId>.txt | Door files |
| \Library\Loot\<NPCtype>.txt | Loot files |
| \Library\Mobiles\<MobileId>.txt | NPC files |
| \Library\Objects\<ObjectId>.txt | Object files |
| \Library\Rooms\<RoomId>.txt | Room files |

| \Library\Shops\<RoomId>.txt | Shop files |
| \Library\Sql\<DescriptiveName>.txt | Sql statements |
| \Library\Talk\<NPC type>.txt | Talk files |
| \Library\World\Map\<MapDatabase>.mdb | zMapper Access database |
| \Library\World\Mobiles\<MobileId>.txt | Specifies NPC spawn information |
| \Library\World\Objects\<ObjectId.txt> | Specifies Object spawn information |

| \Library\Motd.txt | Message of the day |
| \Library\Social.txt | Socials |
| \Library\ValidCommands.txt | Commands control file |
| \Library\ValidNames.txt | Valid player names |

## 2 Rooms
Rooms are used to define the virtual world. Nothing can exist if there are no rooms, everything is 'in' some room within the virtual world. The term 'room' is used regardless of whether the place is a bedroom, street, river, field, forest, etc. Rooms should be connected in 'geographically' sensible manner. For example, you would not want to connect an upstairs bedroom directly to the street below. It would make more sense to have the bedroom connect to a hallway, then some stairs, then out the door and onto the street.

Rooms are specified in the \Library\Rooms directory as <RoomId>.txt. For example, ArmorShop.txt would contain specifications for RoomId ArmorShop.

### 2.1 Room specification
A room is specified as follows:

```text
RoomId:       xxxx
RoomType:     xxxx
Terrain:      xxxx
RoomName:     xxxx
RoomDesc:     xxxx
End of RoomDesc
ExitName:     xxxx
ExitDesc:     xxxx
ExitToRoomId: <RoomId>
End of Exits
End of Room
```

**Room Id**<br>
This must be unique within the whole virtual world.

**RoomType**<br>
Describes the type of room using one or more of the following codes separated by spaces:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| None | Nothing special about this room |
| Dark | Player must be carrying a light to see |
| Drink | Player may drink from <RoomName> |
| NoFight | No fighting |
| NoNPC | NPC are not allowed to enter this room from another room |

**Terrain**<br>
The type of terrain effects number of movement points used when a player enters a room. It also effects the rate of food and water consumption. Terrain must be one of the following:

- Inside
- Street
- Road
- Field
- Forest
- Swamp
- Desert
- Hill
- Mountain

**RoomName**<br>
This is the room's name and is displayed to players upon entering a room.

**RoomDesc**<br>
This is the room's description and is displayed to players upon entering a room. It should be as descriptive as possible, but should not tell the player how he/she feels. Room descriptions should, in general, be longer than one line. The room description is free form and is displayed to the player 'as is'  including blank lines and spaces.

**End of RoomDesc**<br>
This line indicates the end of the room description.

**ExitName**<br>
This text is the name of the exit displayed to the player. A player will use this name to exit the room or manipulate the door, if a door is specified. ExitName must be unique for this room.

**ExitDesc**<br>
This text will be displayed to the player when using the command 'look ExitName'. The text should start on the next line.

**ExitToRoomId**<br>
This is the unique id of the room to which the player will be moved when using the command
'go ExitName'.

**End of Exits**<br>
This line indicates the end of all exit information. Even if there are no exits, this line is required

**End of Room**<br>
This line indicates the end of all room information

#### A note about room exits
Exits allow a player to move from room to room. A room may have from zero exits to ?? exits, where ?? is a ridiculously high number. Exits specifications are a repeating, orderly, and logical group. For each exit, code all the 'exit' specifications. An exit from one room is an entrance to another room, so exits/entrances must match. For example, assume two rooms say and Entry and a Dining Room. The Entry would have an exit to the Dining room and the Dining Room would have an exit to the Entry.

### 2.2 Room examples
The specifications for two example rooms follows:

#### Room example 1 \Library\Rooms\Entry.txt

```text
RoomId:       Entry
RoomType:     NoFight
Terrain:      Inside
RoomName:     Entry
RoomDesc:
  A stand with a flower arrangement setting on it adorns
the corner to your left. A chandelier hangs from the two
story ceiling casting away any shadows. A long flight of
stairs leads upstairs to the bedrooms.
End of RoomDesc

ExitName:     DiningRoom
ExitDesc:     You see the dining room with table and chairs.
ExitToRoomId: DiningRoom

End of Exits

End of Room
```

#### Room example 2 \Library\Rooms\DiningRoom.txt

```text
RoomId:       DiningRoom
RoomType:     NoFight NoNPC
Terrain:      Inside
RoomName:     Dining Room
Desc:
  A large table sits under a candle chandelier. Three pictures
are hung on one wall. On another wall is a magnolia wreath.
End of RoomDesc
ExitName:     Entry
ExitDesc:     You see the Entry.
ExitToRoomId: Entry

End of Exits

End of Room
```

These two examples define two rooms both have terrain type of 'inside'. RoomId Entry is named Entry and RoomId DinningRoom is named Dining Room. Fighting is not allowed in either room and no NPCs are not allowed in the Dinning Room.

## 3 Doors
Doors are defined in terms of the relationship between Rooms and Exits. So, in Room Example 2 above, if you wanted a door between the DiningRoom and the Entry, the DoorId would be DiningRoomEntry. Now, there is also a door when going from the Entry to the DiningRoom which is in fact the other side of the same door, but with a DoorId of EntryDiningRoom. A door specification is actually a pair of specifications, one for each side of the door. Opening/closing one side of the door automatically cause the other side to be opened/closed, also unlocking/locking one side of the door automatically cause the other side to be unlocked/locked. It is possible to have a door that can be unlocked/locked from only one side by having one side have a key and other side not have a key.

Doors are specified in the \Library\Doors directory as <RoomId><RoomId>.txt.

### 3.1 Door specification
A door is defined as a pair of these specifications:

```text
DoorId:           <RoomId><RoomId>
DoorName:         <name>
InitialState:     Open|Closed
LockInitialState: NoLock|Locked|Unlocked
KeyObjectId:      None|<ObjectId>
ResetInterval:    <time>
```

**DoorId**<br>
The first specification is the concatenation of RoomId and an ExitToRoomId. The second specification is a concatenation of the same ExitToRoomId and the same RoomId.

**DoorName**<br>
The name that the player must use to refer to this particular door when opening, closing, locking, or unlocking the door. Typically this will be simply 'door', but it could be 'gate' or anything else.

**InitialState**<br>
This controls whether the door is open or closed when the games starts and is specified as  'Open' or 'Closed'. This is the state the door will normally be in when encountered by a player.

**ResetInterval**<br>
This controls how long before the door is returned to the InitialState after a player opens/closes the door. It also controls how long before the lock is returned to the LockInitialState after being locked/unlocked by a player. ResetInterval <time> is specified as a series of  7 integer numbers, each separated from the next by a space and in the following sequence:

- seconds
- minutes
- hours
- days
- weeks
- months
- years

**LockInitialState**<br>
Specifies the state of the lock when the game starts.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| NoLock | The door has no lock and cannot be locked or unlocked. |
| Locked | The door has a lock which will normally be locked |
| Unlocked | The door has a lock which will normally be unlocked |

**KeyObjectId**<br>
The ObjectId of the key which fits the lock. The player must have the key in their inventory when they issue the lock/unlock command. If LockInitialState is Locked or Unlocked, then a valid ObjectId must be specified. The object must, of course, be defined as type 'key'. If LockInitialState is NoLock, then 'None' must be specified for the KeyObjectId.

### 3.2 Door side 1 example
The specifications for an example door \Library\Doors\DiningRoomEntry.txt follows:

```text
DoorId:           DiningRoomEntry
DoorName:         Door
InitialState:     Closed
ResetInterval:    0 2 0 0 0 0 0
LockInitialState: Locked
KeyObjectId:      HouseKey
```

### 3.3 Door side 2 example
The specifications for an example door \Library\Doors\EntryDiningRoom.txt follows:

```text
DoorId:           EntryDiningRoom
DoorName:         Door
InitialState:     Closed
ResetInterval:    0 2 0 0 0 0 0
LockInitialState: Locked
KeyObjectId:      HouseKey
```

The two examples define a door between the DiningRoom and the Entry that is normally closed and locked, will return to closed and locked state after 2 minutes of being opened, and requires the player to have an object in their inventory with an ObjectId of  HouseKey to unlock or lock the door.

Some of the values between the two side of a door may be different, such as DoorName, LockInitialState, and KeyObjectid. This is not recommended, but could be used in special cases such as creating a door that can be only be unlocked/locked from one side by setting KeyObjectId to 'None' on one side of the door.

### 3.4 Valid door states and transitions

#### Door states

```text
Open    NoLock
Open    Unlocked
Closed  NoLock
Closed  Unlocked
Closed  Locked
```

#### Door state transitions

```text
OpenNoLock      -> Close  -> ClosedNoLock
OpenUnlocked    -> Close  -> CloseUnlocked
ClosedNoLock    -> Open   -> OpenNoLock
ClosedUnlocked  -> Open   -> OpenUnlocked
ClosedUnlocked  -> Lock   -> ClosedLocked
ClosedLocked    -> Unlock -> ClosedUnlocked
```

#### Current door status
When the game is running. the current status of the doors is tracked in the \Running\Doors directory. The primary door tracks the open/closed status of both the primary and secondary doors as well as the status of the lock on that side of the door. The secondary door tracks only the status of the lock on that side of the door. Possible file content combinations are show below:

```text
DiningRoomEntry.txt
Open|Closed NoLock|Locked|Unlocked
EntryDinigRoom.txt
Open|Closed NoLock|Locked|Unlocked
```

## 4 NPCs
NPCs represent everything that is living with the virtual world, other than players. When building your virtual world, it might be helpful to categorize NPCs. For example: enemies, shopkeepers, guards, citizens, hostile animals, and friendly animals. The server does not distinguish between these categories, but as you create the NPCs you would give each category similar attributes. Shopkeepers and guards should have high hitpoints and hit very hard. Killing citizens and friendly animals should cause the player's faction for that NPC to go down very quickly. Be sure to keep the NPCs within the realms of believability for the virtual world you are creating. If you are creating a historical virtual world set in the time of the Roman Empire, you would not have dragons, skeletons, goblins, and the like. It would be appropriate to have Huns, Goths, Greeks, Egyptians, and the like.

NPCs are specified in the \Library\Mobiles directory as <MobileId>.txt. For example, SmallRat.txt would contain specifications for Mobile SmallRat.

### 4.1 NPC specification
An NPC is specified as follows:

```text
MobileId:  xxxx
Names:     xxxx xxxx xxxx
Sex:       xxxx
Desc1:     xxxx
Desc2:     xxxx
Desc3:     xxxx
End Desc3
Action:    xxxx
Faction:   xxx
Level:     99
HitPoints: 99999
Armor:     999
Attack:    xxxx
Damage:    99999
ExpPoints: 99999
Loot:      <NPCtype>
Talk:      <NPCtype>
```

**MobileId**<br>
This must be unique within the whole virtual world. Players can use this id to identify the NPC.

**Names**<br>
A list of names, separated by spaces, that a player can use to identify the NPC.

**Sex**<br>
The sex of the NPC. It must be one of the following codes:
| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| F | Female |
| M | Male |
| N | Neutral |

**Desc1**<br>
The description of the NPC used when the NPC takes some action. For example, a short description of "the Mangy Mutt" would result in messages such as "The Mangy Mutt leaves south." and "The Mangy Mutt bites you for 5 points of damage.". Desc1 should never end with a punctuation mark because it will be used as part of sentences such as those above. If Desc1 starts a sentence, the first letter of the first word will be capitalized,.

**Desc2**<br>
The description displayed when the NPC is just hanging out. For example, "The Mangy Mutt is here, running around and barking." Desc2 should be a complete sentence including the appropriate punctuation and capitalization.

**Desc3**<br>
The description displayed when a player looks at the NPC by typing 'look <mobile>'. Desc3 can be multi-line and will be displayed to the player 'as is' including blank lines and spaces.

**End of Mobile Desc3**<br>
This line indicates the end of the Desc3 specification.

**Action**<br>
Action is used modify the behavior of the NPC. Upper and lowercase must be specified exactly as shown. If no action code is required, specify only 'Action:', thereby indicating a blank action code. If multiple codes are selected, separate the codes by one space. The following codes may be selected:
| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| None | just an ordinary mobile |
| Aggro | will attack a player without warning and without considering faction |
| Faction | will determine whether or not to attack player based on factions |
| Destroy | will destroy any object laying around that can be taken |
| Help | will help other NPCs in the same room that are being attacked |
| NoMove | will not move |
| Wimpy | will flee when about to die |

**Faction**<br>
Use one of the following to describe the NPC's faction. Faction is used to determine whether or not an NPC that is sensitive to factions (Action set to Faction) will attack a player without provocation. It is required, but will be ignored if the 'Action' codes do not include 'Faction'. It must be one of the following:
- Good
- Lawful
- Neutral
- Lawless
- Evil

**Level**<br>
This number is the level of the NPC. Level is used when creating an NPC to establish HitPoints, Armor, Damage, and ExpPoints, each of which can be modified.

**HitPoints**<br>
This number is added to the NPC’s base HitPoints. This allows the NPCs to be created that are more difficult than the standard NPC for a given level. Negative numbers are also allowed, thus making an NPC easier than normal. This number should be zero for most NPCs.

**Armor**<br>
This number is added to the NPC’s base Armor and determines the ability of the NPC to avoid damage. Not implemented.

**Attack**<br>
This specifies the type of attack the NPC will use during combat to produce the appropriate message. It is converted to lower case because it is used in the middle of a sentence. For example,  The Mangy Mutt bites you for 5 points of damage. Attack must be one of the following:
- bites
- claws
- crushes
- hits
- mauls
- pierces
- punches
- slashes
- stabs
- stings
- thrashes

**Damage**<br>
This number is added to the NPC’s base Damage. Damage is the amount of damage the NPC can do per round. This is not the exact amount of damage, a random number of damage points will be added or subtracted from this number for each round of combat to obtain the actual amount of damage. Negative numbers are also allowed, thus making an NPC easier than normal. This number should be zero for most NPCs.

**ExpPoints**<br>
This number is added to the NPC’s base ExpPoints. ExpPoints is the number of experience points used to award experience to players when the NPC is killed. Negative numbers are also allowed, thus making an NPC give less experience than normal. This number should be zero for most NPCs.

**Loot**<br>
Specify <NPCtype> like dog, bee, snake, etc. This MUST match exactly an existing NPCtype located in \Library\Loot..

**Talk**<br>
Specify <NPCtype> like dog, bee, snake, etc. This MUST match exactly an existing NPCtype located in \Library\Talk..

### 4.2 NPC examples
The specifications for two example NPCs follows:

#### NPC example 1 \Library\Mobiles\MangyMutt.txt

```text
MobileId:  MangyMutt
Names:     Mangy Mutt
Sex:       Neutral
Desc1:     The Mangy Mutt
Desc2:     The Mangy Mutt is here, running around and barking.

When a player kills it, the player receives the base experience points for a level 1 NPC, plus 5 extra experience points. A loot and talk file named 'Dog.txt' already exist in the \Library\Loot and \Library\Talk directories.

#### NPC example 2 \Library\Mobiles\SandScorpion.txt

```text

When a player kills it, the player receives and extra 25 experience points. A loot and talk file named 'Scorpion.txt' already exist in the \Library\Loot directory and \Library\Talk must contain a file name 'None.txt' which would be empty.

## 5 Objects
Objects are specified in the \Library\Objects directory as <ObjectId>.txt. For example, RedApple.txt would contain specifications for Object RedApple.

### 5.1 Object specification
An object is specified as follows:

```text
ObjectId: xxxx
Names:    xxxx xxxx xxxx
Desc1:    xxxx
Desc2:    xxxx
Desc3:    xxxx
End Desc3
Weight:   99

A list of names, separated by spaces, that a player uses to identify the object. At least one of these names must be unique within the whole virtual world, for example the ObjectId.

**Desc1**<br>
The description displayed when the object is used. For example, a short description of "a long, green stick" would result in messages such as "The Mangy Mutt picks up the long, green stick.". Desc1 should be kept short and should never end with a punctuation mark because it will be inserted into the middle of sentences.

**Desc2**<br>
The description displayed when the object is just there. For example, "A folded robe is lying here". Desc2 should be kept short and should end with appropriate punctuation.

**Desc3**<br>
The description displayed for the object when a player examines the object by typing 'examine <object>'. Desc3 should be a fairly descriptive and should typically be more than one line

**End Desc3**<br>
This line indicates the end of Desc3.

**Weight**<br>

### 5.2 Object type specifications
All object types are listed below with explanations. Some object types require additional specifications that are unique to that object type. For example, an object type of 'Weapon' requires additional specifications of 'WeaponType'  and 'WeaponDamage'.

**Armor**<br>
*ArmorValue* - This value is added to the player's armor class when the object is worn and is subtracted from the player's armor class when the object is removed. As a player increases their armor class, the amount of damage taken during fights is reduced. See the World Building section for more about armor class.

### 5.3 Object examples
The specifications for two example objects follows:

#### Object example 1 \Library\Objects\ShortSword.txt

```text

## 6 Shops
Shops are where players can buy and sell items. Shops should be scattered through out the virtual world, but of course should be found mainly in cities and towns with an occasional outpost. Only one shop can exist in a given room and each shop should have a shopkeeper NPC. Typically, each shop specializes in a particular type of item. The shops you create might include a weapon shop, armor shop, jewelry shop, or a bazaar that buys and sells a mixture of items.

Shops are specified in the \Library\Shops directory as <RoomId>.txt. For example, ArmorShop.txt would contain specifications for Shop ArmorShop.

### 6.1 Shop specification
Each shop is specified in a separate file whose name MUST match exactly the name of an existing RoomId in the \Library\Rooms directory. The shop codes are specified as follows:

```text
<shop welcome message>
Item:		<ObjectId>
.
.
.
Item:		<ObjectId>

End of Items

End of Shop
```

<shop welcome message>
The message given to a player when the player issues the 'list' command.

Item
Item that this shop will buy and sell. ObjectId MUST match exactly an ObjectId that exists in the \Library\Objects directory. This specification is repeated for each item bought and sold in this shop.

End of Items
This line indicates the end of the list of items.

End of Shop
This line indicates the end of the shop specifications.

### 6.2 Shop example
The specifications for an example shop \Library\Shops\WeaponShop follows:

```text
Welcome to my weapon shop

Item: RustySword
Item: BluntAxe
Item: KindlingAxe
Item: SmallClub
Item: TinyDagger
Item: SimpleHammer
Item: CrackedSpear
Item: LongStick

End of Items

End of Shop
```

The message "Welcome to my weapon shop" will be displayed when the player issues the 'list' command. This shop sells a variety of weapons.

## 7 Loot
Loot refers to items given to player's upon the defeat of an enemy. Loot items should 'make sense' for a given NPC. For example, loot for a rat could be a rat ear or two, a rat tail, and several whiskers. Rat loot would not include items like a shepherd's staff, a loaf of bread, or a helmet.

Loot is specified in the \Library\Loot directory as <NPCtype>.txt. For example, Rat.txt would contain specifications for rat loot.

### 7.1 Loot specification
Each NPCtype is specified in a separate file whose name MUST match exactly the 'loot' specification in an NPC specification. The loot is specified as follows:

```text
<count> <percent> <ObjectId>
```

<count>
The NPC has this many of the specified object . When more than 1 is specified, the object is considered <count> times for looting.

<percent>
The chance the player has of getting this object.

<ObjectId>
The ObjectId of the object. This MUST match exactly an ObjectId specified in the \Library\Objects directory.

### 7.2 Loot example
The specifications for an example loot file \Library\Loot\Bee.txt follows:

```text
1 50 BeeStinger
2 65 BeeWing
```

The first line specifies that a bee will have 1 BeeStringer and the player will have a 50% chance of getting that object for each bee killed. The second specifies that a bee will have 2 wings and the player will have a 65% chance of getting that object for each bee killed.

## 8 Talk
Talk enables NPCs to respond when a player 'hails' them by issuing the 'hail' command. Talk specifications are typically grouped by NPCtype. For example, thief for all thieves, guard for all guards, merchant for all merchants.

Talk is specified in the \Library\Talk directory as <NPCtype>.txt. For example, Thief.txt would contain specifications for any thief speaking..

### 8.1 Talk specification
Each NPCtype is specified in a separate file whose name MUST match exactly the 'talk' specification in an NPC specification. Talk is specified as follows:

```text
Maximum Message Number <count>

Message <sequence number>
<message text>
End of Message

End of Messages
```

Maximum Message Number <count>
<count > is simple the number of messages. Each time a player hails an NPC, a random number is generated between 1 and <count> to determine which message will be used to respond to the player.

Message <sequence number>
The first message must be sequence number 1, the second message must be sequence number two, etc.

<message text>
This message, when selected, will be displayed 'as is' to the player including spaces and blank lines.

End of Message
This line indicates the end of a message.

End of Messages
This line indicates the end of all messages.

### 8.2 Talk example
The specifications for an example talk file \Library\Loot\Thief.txt follows:

```text
Maximum Message Number 2

Message 1
  I will relieve you of the burden of living!
End of Message

Message 2
  I will steal your heart!
End of Message

End of Messages
```

## 9 World
The world files are used to 'spawn' NPCs. Spawning is the process by which NPCs enter the world and it controls how many bees, snakes, thieves, etc there are in the world at any given time and how often they return after being killed. Objects could also be spawned, but currently that functionality is not implemented.

### 9.1 NPC spawn specifications
NPC spawning is specified in the \Library\World\Mobiles directory as <MobileId>.txt. For example, Viper.txt would contain specifications for spawning vipers.

Each NPC to be spawned is specified in a separate file whose name MUST match exactly an existing NPC in the \Library\Mobiles directory. NPC spawning is specified as follows:

```text
MaxInWorld: <count>
RoomId:     <RoomId>
Interval:   <time>
```

MaxInWorld
This controls the maximum number of the specified NPC that can exist in the world at the same time.

RoomId
The RoomId into which the NPC will spawn. This RoomId MUST exist in the \Library\Rooms directory.

Interval
This determines the amount of time that will elapse between the time an NPC is killed and when they spawn again. Interval <time> is specified as a series of  7 integer numbers, each separated from the next by a space and in the following sequence:
seconds
minutes
hours
days
weeks
months
years

### 9.2 NPC spawn example
The specifications for an example NPC spawn file \Library\World\Mobiles\SmallRat.txt follows:

```text
MaxInWorld: 30
RoomId:     RatSpawnRoom220
Interval:   0 2 0 0 0 0 0
```

This specification will cause 30 small rats to be spawned into RoomId RatSpawnRoom220 two minutes after the game is started. Additionally, when OMugs determines that the number of small rats in the world has fallen below 30, the appropriate number of small rats are scheduled for spawning 2 minutes later in order to bring the small rat count back up to 30,

### 9.3 Object spawn specifications
The object spawning functionality is not implemented.

## 10 Socials
Socials provide a means for players to communicate with each other without 'saying' something. Socials provide another opportunity for the virtual world builder to be creative and have some fun. Some common socials are smile, wave, point, and laugh.

It is important to maintain the atmosphere of the game when creating socials. For example, a virtual world set in the modern day United States probably would not include a 'curtsey' social, but a 'curtsey' would be fit nicely in a virtual world set in medieval times.

Socials are specified in the \Library\Socials.txt file.

### 10.1 Social specification
Socials have two forms, the two line form and the seven line form. The two line form is for socials that do not have a target. The seven line form is for socials that may have a target.

A two line social is specified as follows:

```text
Social : xxxx
MinPos : xxxx
Lines  : 2
Message to player
Message to all players in the room
```

A seven line social is specified as follows:

```text
Social : xxxx
MinPos : xxxx
Lines  : 7
Message to player when no target is given
Message to all players in the room when no target is given
Message to player when target is player
Message to player when target is not in the room
Message to player when target is given
Message to target when target is given
Message to all players in the room when target is given
```

Social
The unique name of the social. This is used by players just like any command and must be only one word.

MinPos
This is the minimum position the player must be in to execute the social. The order of the positions are from lowest to highest: sleep, sit, stand. This must be one of those three values.

Lines
This is the number of lines in the social and it must be either a '2' or a '7'. A two line social cannot have a target, but a 7 line social may or may not have a target.

Messages
The messages may contain any combination of the following substitution codes:
```
Code               Is replaced with
$P                 player's name
$T                 target player's name
$pHeShe            he or she,          based on the player's sex
$pHimHer           him or her,         based on the player's sex
$pHisHers          his or hers,        based on the player's sex
$pHimselfHerself   himself or herself, based on the player's sex
$tHeShe            he or she,          based on the target player's sex
$tHimHer           him or her,         based on the target player's sex
$tHisHers          his or her,         based on the target player's sex
$tHimselfHerself   himself or herself, based on the target player's sex
```
Great care should be taken in creating these messages. It can be difficult to get all these message so that they make sense to the recipient of the message. Write the messages out  first without using the substitution codes can help avoid grammatical errors. Pretend to be the player, the target player, and the other players in the room as see if the message you would receive in each case make sense.

### 10.2 Social examples
The specifications for two example socials, the first is a two line social and the second is a seven line social:

Social example 1, two line social:

```text
Social : grin
MinPos : sit
Lines  : 2
A broad grin spreads across your face.
$P grins broadly.
```

Player must be sitting or standing to grin (cannot be asleep). The grin social does not accept a target. Assume Zeke grins, and that Zak and Zeb are bystanders in the room. Here are the messages each player would receive in response to Zeke's grin social:
Zeke types
grin
Zeke sees
A broad grin spreads across your face.
Zak and Zeb see
Zeke grins broadly.

Social example 2, seven line social:

```text
Social : smile
MinPos : sit
Lines  : 7
You smile.
$P smiles.
Smiling at yourself??
The recipient of your pleasantry is nowhere in sight.
You smile at $T.
$P smiles at you.
$P smiles at $T.
```

Player must be sitting or standing to smile (cannot be sleeping). The smile social may or may not have target. Assume Zeke smiles at Zeesey, and that Zak and Zeb are bystanders in the room. Here are the messages each player would receive in response to Zeke's smile social:
Zeke types

Zeke sees
You smile at Zessey.
Zeesey sees

$P clasps you. You and $pHimHer begin to dance.
$P clasps $T and begins to dance with $tHimHer.
```

You must standing to dance. The dance social may or may not have a target. Assume Zeke a male player and he wants to dance with a female named Zeesey, and that Zak and Zeb are bystanders in the room. Here are the messages each player would receive in response to Zeke's dance social.
Zeke types
Dance Zeesey
Zeke sees
You clasp Zessey and begin to dance with her.
Zeesey sees
Zeke clasps you. You and him begin to dance.
Zak and Zeb see
Zeke clasps Zeesey and begins to dance with her.

## 11 Help
Help is where players will look to learn about the game, the more completely you cover the game in help topics, the easier it will be for players to enjoy the world you have created. At a minimum, there should be a help topic for every player command. There should also be help on general questions, for example a 'travel' topic would describe how a player travels and all the factors that might effect their travels and include references to specific commands like 'go'.

It is important to maintain the atmosphere of the game within the help topics. For example, pay close attention to way in which each command is presented and the content of the command examples.

### 11.1 Help specification

Help is specified as follows:

```text
Help:xxxx
Xxxx xxxx xxxx
Xxxx xxxx xxxx
Related help:xxxx
```

Help
This is the unique help keyword. Leaving this blank for one help entry will cause that entry to be displayed if the player types only 'help'. Everything from this line, down to and including 'Related help', is displayed to the player 'as is', so care should be taken to format the help text in an easy to read manner.

Related help
This is where related help topics are listed and is required.

### 11.2 Help example
The specifications for an example help entry follows:

```text
Help:Go
Go is used to move from where you are now
into an adjacent room.

Usage:Go <exit>
Example: Go N

Related help: Exits
```

This is the help entry for the 'Go' command. It begins with 'Help:Go' and ends with 'Related help: Exists'

```text
Help:
Type 'help' followed by the command you wish
to get help with, like 'help move' or 'help newbie'.

Related help: Newbie
```

This is the help entry will be displayed when a player enters 'help' by itself.

## 12 Player commands
Player commands and parameters are not case sensitive. Each command has a specific usage that includes the follow components:

```text
command	The command
CAPITAL	Indicates parameters that, when used, must be spelled exactly as indicated
{ }     Optional parameters are enclosed within braces
|       Separates a list of possible parameter values
< >     Specifies a value to be supplied by the player
```

Some examples:
The Inventory command's usage is "inventory", which means this command has no parameters.

The Color command's usage is "color {ON | OFF}", which means the player may enter just 'color' or 'color on' or color off'.

The Give command's usage is "give <object> <target>", which means the player must enter "give" followed by the name of an object and the name of the player to whom the player wishes to give the object.

The Group command's usage is " Usage:group  LIST | ON | OFF | NONE | <player>", which means the player must enter "group" followed by "LIST" or "ON" or "OFF" or "NONE" or the name of a player.

## 13 Administrator commands
Administrator commands follow the same syntax rules as player commands. The server will only recognize these commands if the player entering the command has the 'Admin' flag set to 'yes'.

### 13.1 Advance
```
Usage : advance <player> <level>
Advances <player> to the specified <level> and adjusts the player's hitpoints and other statistics as necessary. This command can also be used to demote a player.
```

### 13.2 GoTo
```
Usage : goto <RoomId>
Immediately go to the room specified.
```

### 13.3 GoToArrive
```
Usage : gotoarrrive {<text> | none}
Sets player's arrival message to the <text>. If <text> is not specified, the player's current arrival message is displayed. Specifying 'none' will remove the player's arrival message. Note: text must be less than 61 characters.
```

### 13.4 GoToDepart
```
Usage : gotodepart {<text> | NONE}
Sets player's depart message to the <text>. If <text> is not specified, the player's current depart message is displayed. Specifying 'none' will remove the player's depart message. Note: text must be less than 61 characters not counting color codes.
```

### 13.5 Invisible

Usage : stop
Stops the game immediately, but first all players are saved and forced logged off.
```

### 13.11 Where
```
Usage : where <target>
Specify a player, mobile, or object name in place of  <target>. The where command always searches all player, mobile, and object locations for the specified <target>. A unique name must be specified for target. For example, 'where rat' will return nothing, if the only rats are SmallRat,
LargeRat, and SewerRat. You would instead use 'where smallrat', 'where largerat', or 'where sewerrat'.
```

## 14 World building
This section is intended to provide additional information concerning critical components of a well rounded virtual world.

### 14.1 Armor class
Armor class is the sum of the 'armor value' of all objects worn by the player. Armor class should reflect the amount and quality of armor worn by a player. The primary purpose of armor is to reduce the amount of damage taken during a fight. The following list gives the major factors used to determine the effectiveness of armor.
1.    Armor objects must be created with appropriate 'cost' and 'armor value'.
2.    A player wearing the 'best' armor will still take damage during a fight.
3.    A maximum value for armor class must be established.

It is difficult to give much advice concerning item #1, but it might help to design sets of armor for beginner, intermediate, and advanced players. The 'cost' of a piece of armor should reflect its 'armor value', meaning the better the armor, the more it cost.

Armor reduces damage, so item #2 is defined by establishing the  Maximum Damage Reduction Percent or (MDRP). The MDRP is specified as number ranging from 1 to 99. For example, setting MDRP to 60, means the damage taken by a fully armored player is reduced by 60%.

Item #3 is defined as Maximum Armor Class or MAC. Care must be taken when designing armor objects so that a player's armor cannot exceed the MAC value. On the other hand, making this value to large could render the player's armor virtually ineffective.

The player's armor class, MAC, and MDRP are used to determine the player's Damage Reduction Percentage or DRP which in turn is used to reduce the amount damage taken during a fight. The following  describes the calculation of DRP.

#### Damage Reduction Percentage calculation
Term definitions:
```
POP   Percent Of Protection, ranges from 0% to 100% protected
PAC   Player's Armor Class, ranges from 0 to MAC
MAC   Maximum Armor Class, your choice
MDRP  Maximum Damage Reduction Percent, your choice
DRP   Damage Reduction Percent, what we are calculating

Calculations:
POP = PAC / MAC * 100
DRP = POP * MDRP / 100

Example:
PAC  = 12     (Add up player's armor values)
MAC  = 300    (your choice)
MDRP = 60%    (your choice)
POP  = 12 / 300 * 100 = 4%
DRP  = 4 * 60 / 100 = 2.4%
```
In this example, the player's armor provides 4% protection which in turn will reduce the damage taken by 2.4%.

#### Combat example
Let's assume Ixaka is fighting a viper.
```
Given:
Ixaka's armor class is 17 (PAC)
Maximum armor class is 300 (MAC)
Maximum damage reduction percent is 60 (MDRP)
Viper bites Ixaka for 15 points of damage (POD)

Damage to Ixaka (DTI):
DTI = floor(POD - DRP)
DTI = POD - POP * MDRP / 100
DTI = POD - ((PAC / MAC * 100) * MDRP / 100)
DTI = 15 - ((17 / 300 * 100) * 60 / 100)
DTI = 15 - 3.39%
DTI = 14.49
DTI = floor(14.49) = 14
```
