## 1 Introduction

This document is intended to give a 'would be' OMugs coder a head start on understanding the OMugs codebase. Most of the code is NOT discussed here, only selected portions of the codebase are discussed here. What about the rest? Go read the code! There are several code snippets in this document. These snippets are not intended to be complete or be the actual code in the current version of OMugs. They are used to explain key portions of the code.

## 2 Code Overview

OMugs is developed on Microsoft Windows using Visual Studio 2026 and C++. The project uses Visual Studio’s WSL support for Linux builds, debugging, and testing while keeping Windows and Visual Studio as the primary development environment.

### 2.1 Style

There is a distinct style used when writing code for OMugs. Hallmarks of that style include, consistent indentation, braces are always on a separate line, severely limited use of macros, no function overloading, no pointers to functions, readable function and variable names, statements like IF, FOR, WHILE are always followed by a set of braces, even if there is only one statement inside the braces.

### 2.2 Organization

The code high level is of course Main.cpp whose primary task is to fire off BigDog, the driver for the game server. The source code file name are intended to be obvious as to each files general area of responsibility.

### 2.3 Communications

OMugs is a telnet server and uses a small subset of  Socket functions to communicate with the players. The two most often used functions are recv and send. Sends and receives are done using nonblocking function calls thereby enabling multiple sockets with simultaneous pending operations.

### 2.4 Variables

OMugs functionality centers around sending and receiving text data. Therefore a significant percentage of the variables are strings. There are a number of useful functions to manipulate strings. OMugs relies heavily on the string functions. Most variables are string, int, or bool. All external data is stored in standard windows text files and can be easily viewed and changed using a text editor of your choosing.

As one reviews the OMugs codebase, one might notice that it uses a relatively simple, conservative style of C++, with few advanced language features.

OMugs maintains a persistent state by not storing anything about the state of the server in memory. Everything is externalized to text files and then read from the file when it is needed. If the server crashed, upon restart the state of the server is in the external text files ready for use.

### 2.5 Classes

Classes in OMugs are used primarily to organize related code. They are not arranged into inheritance hierarchies, and the project is best understood as one large program where classes provide a practical way to group related functions and data. The code also avoids heavy use of getter and setter methods.

## 3 Coding Conventions

A consistent look is critical to the development and maintainability of the OMugs codebase. The OMugs coding motto: KIASAP - Keep It As Simple As Possible. OMugs code will not be the most efficient, terse, tight code. It will, however, be as maintainable as possible. In spite of the KIASAP motto, there will be portions of code that even its creator will be baffled as to what the code does, only months or even days after coding it. These occurrences should be minimized as much as possible.

### 3.1 Variable Names

Variable names should be as readable as possible. For example, use a name like 'PlayerStateWaitNameConfirmation' as opposed to something like 'PlStNmCn' or worse 'plstnmcn'. Each word is capitalized and does not use special characters to separate words. Naming variables using a single letter such as 'n' is acceptable, but only in limited situations like:

```cpp
  int n;
  ...
  n = WordList.Find(Word);
  if (n == -1)
  ...
```

### 3.2 !Terse

Minimize the terseness of the code. Terse code can make it more difficult to debug and/or explore the code. For example, by coding

```cpp
  n = WordList.Find(Word);
  if (n == -1)
```

instead of

```cpp
  if (WordList.Find(Word) == -1)
```

it is possible to see the result of the 'Find' function when using the MSVC interactive debugger.

Avoid writing complex if statements like

```cpp
if (condition1 && condition2 || (condition4 && condition5))
```

Use white space

```cpp
  x = y + z
```

instead of

```cpp
  x=y+z
```

Use macros only for value substitution NOT code substitution. Macros are limited to substitutions like

```cpp
  #define GRP_LIMIT             4
  #define HELP_FILE_NAME        "./Library/"
```

### 3.3 Functions

Function names follow the same naming convention as variable names. In general, simple values should be passed by value unless the function needs to modify the caller’s variable or avoid copying a large object. For example, prefer:

```cpp
  void FirstFunction(int FirstValue)
```

instead of

```cpp
  void FirstFunction(int *FirstValue)
```

This works well in OMugs because many values passed to functions are either copied simple values, class members already available to the function, or values that the function does not need to change.

Return from functions as soon as possible. For example, in the DoLook function there is a return as soon as it is determined that the Look command cannot be completed.

```cpp
void Communication::DoLook(Dnode *pDnodeActor, CString CmdStr)
{
. . . .

  if (IsSleeping(pDnodeActor))
  { // Player is sleeping, send msg, command is not done
    return;
  }
. . . .
}
```

### 3.4 Class Template

The following is the code template used to define all classes. The PLAYER class is defined in this template.

```cpp
/***********************************************************

## 4 The Codebase

This section outlines the flow of the code and is intended as a way to 'get into' the code as opposed to explaining everything in great detail. It is best used with the OMugs MSVC project and frequent use of the 'Find in Files' option. The following is an outline showing the flow of the code at a high level.

BigDog

OpenPort

InitDescriptor

CheckForNewConnections

NewConnection

Dnode object constructor

RecvIt

SendIt

CommandParse

### 4.1 BigDog

Yep, this is it, THE BIG DOG. This function is the origin of all that is OMugs. An old sage once said, "If you can't run with the big dogs, stay on the porch". So here is what BigDog looked like at some point during development. Although this is not exactly what you currently find in the codebase, this version has the critical components.

```cpp
 1 void BigDog()
 2 {
 3  int MilliSecondsToSleep;
 4
 5  srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
 6  StateRunning        = true;
 7  MilliSecondsToSleep = 250;
 8  OpenFileLog();
 9  LogIt("OMugs has started");
10  OpenPort(PORT_NBR);
11  InitDescriptor();
12  while (StateRunning)
13  {
14    Sleep(MilliSecondsToSleep);
15    if (!StateStopping)
16    {
17      CheckForNewConnections();
18    }
19    RecvIt();
20  }
21  LogIt("OMugs has stopped");
22  CloseFileLog();
23  ClosePort();
24 }
```

Line 5 - Uses time to seed the random number function

Line 8 - Opens  the Log

Line 10 - Begins listening on port specified

Line 11 - Initializes the list of connections

Line 12 thru 20 - The main server loop

Line 14 - Sleep, so this process doesn't hog the cpu

Line 17 - Checks for new connections and creates new connections as needed

Line 19 - Receives and sends text to and from the players and disconnects players.

Line 22 - Closes the Log

### 4.2 OpenPort(int port)

Begins listening on the assigned port for new connections.

### 4.3 InitDescriptor

Initializes the pointers used to manage a linked list of connections.

### 4.4 CheckForNewConnections

The following code can be found very near to top of CheckForNewConnections. This is the code that is used in numerous places throughout OMugs to loop through the connections.

```cpp
1  Descriptor::SetpDnodeCursorFirst();
2  while (!Descriptor::EndOfDnodeList())
3  {
4    pDnodeActor = Descriptor::GetDnode();
5    FD_SET(pDnodeActor->DnodeFd, &InpSet);
6    FD_SET(pDnodeActor->DnodeFd, &OutSet);
7    FD_SET(pDnodeActor->DnodeFd, &ExcSet);
8    Descriptor::SetpDnodeCursorNext();
9 }
```

Line 1 - Point to the first connection in the list

Line 2 - Is this the end of the list

Line 4 - Get pointer to the current Dnode object (which is the connection)

Line 5 thru 7 - Do stuff with the current connection (this can be anything)

Line 8 - Advance the pointer to the next connection

Near the end of CheckForNewConnections is the follow line of code, which will add the new connection to the list of connections.

```cpp
    NewConnection(ListenSocket);
```

### 4.5 NewConnection

This function handles new connections and establishes a nonblocking socket. Near the bottom of this function are the following two lines of code

```cpp
1  pDnodeActor = new Dnode(SocketHandle);
2  FdList->AppendIt(pDnodeActor);
```

Line 1 - Constructs a new Dnode object, which used to communicate with players

Line 2 - Appends this new connection to the list of connections

### 4.6 Dnode(int SocketHandle)

The Dnode class constructor initializes the variables that are used to communicate with the players and track the 'state' of the connection.

```cpp
1  Count++;
2  DnodeFd                             = SocketHandle;
3  pPlayer                             = NULL;
4  PlayerInp                           = "";
5  PlayerName                          = "";
6  PlayerNewCharacter                  = "";
7  PlayerOut                           = "";
8  PlayerPassword                      = "";
9  PlayerWrongPasswordCount            = 0;
```

Line 1 - Keeps a count of the number of connections

Line 2 - Assigns the socket handle to the DnodeFd variable

Line 3 - Pointer to the player object

Line 4 - Player input is kept here until it is processed (see function RecvIt)

Line 5 - At this point in the code there is no player object, so store player name here

Line 6 - A 'Y' or 'N' switch

Line 7 - Player output is kept here until it is processed (see function SendIt)

Line 8 - Player's response to password question

Line 9 - Count of attempts to enter correct password, 3 chances to get it right

### 4.7 SockRecv

The code in this function is all contained within a loop that checks each connection. See CheckForNewConnections for the 'loop through the connections code'. It primary function is to receive player input, send output to players, and call the command parser.

```cpp
1 ::recv(pDnodeActor->DnodeFd, InpStr, MAX_INPUT_LENGTH-1, 0);
2 SendIt(pDnodeActor, BufferOut);
3 CommandParse(pDnodeActor);
```

Line 1 - Receives player input and places it in InpStr

Line 2 - Calls the send routine

Line 3 - Calls the command parser, if there is input

### 4.8 SockSend

The code in this function could have just stayed in SockRecv, but the nesting was getting too deep, so it was split out.

```cpp
1 Written = ::send(pDnodeActor->DnodeFd, arg, Length, 0);

Line 1 - Send output to player, The variable 'Written' is the number of characters the '::send' was able to send. 'Written' is compared against the total bytes that should have been sent and used to preserve the unsent characters to be sent via the next '::send'.
```

### 4.9 CommandParse

This function parses player commands and then calls the appropriate function. The following lines can be used to divide the command parser into logical sections.

```cpp
1 /* Isolate a single player command */
2 /* Player logon */
3 /* Separate the command from the command string */
4 /* COLOR command */
5 /* SOCIAL command */
6 /* Bad command */
```

1 - Each player command must end with a line return. Due to nonblocking communication between a player and the server, input must be accumulated until a line feed is found. Then it is assumed that a complete command has been found and is ready to be processed.

2 - When a player first connects to OMugs, they must reply to a series of prompts to complete the logon process.

3 - This section of code separates the one word command from the rest of the player input. Some commands require additional translations. For example, a player may enter 'n' instead of 'go north'. The command processor does not understand 'n', but does understand 'go north'.

4 - This begins the section of code that determines what command was entered and then calls the appropriate function to process that command.

5 - If the command does not match any of the previous commands, then maybe it is a social command, like smile, laugh, grin, frown, etc. Social commands are stored in an external file and therefore can be added or deleted without recompiling the code.

6 - The command parser gives up trying to figure out what the player entered.

### 4.10 pDnodeActor

This variable points to the connection being processed and has a pointer the corresponding player object. Throughout the code pDnodeActor refers to the player who entered the command, pDnode2 is the target of the command (if any), and pDnode3 refers to others. Some common references using pDnodeActor are:

```cpp
pDnodeActor->PlayerOut                            Output to be sent to player
pDnodeActor->pPlayer->CreatePrompt()    Player class function to create the prompt
```

### 4.11 SendToRoom

This function is used to send messages to players that are in the same room as the player who issued a given command.  For example, player Ixaka issues the following command

'say Hi!'. As a result all players in the same room as Ixaka with see the following message: Ixaka says: Hi!

When Ixaka issues the 'say' command, the function SendToRoom is called.  The SendToRoom function requires the following parameters:

```cpp
string TargetRoomId, Dnode *pDnodeActor, Dnode *pDnode2, string MsgText
```

TargetRoomId is the RoomId of the originating player

*pDnodeActor is the pointer to the originating player

*pDnode2 is the pointer to the target player

MsgText is the message to be send to the players in the TargetRoomId

*pDnodeActor and *pDnode2 are used to control who actually gets the message and these pointers can be NULL, meaning all players will see the message. SendToRoom therefore has several variations:

SendToRoom variation 1

In DoGive the player receives a message, the target player receives a different message, and everyone else in the room receives a third variation of the message. The originating player and target player should not get a message from the SendToRoom function, so the following code is used:

```cpp
SendToRoom(pDnodeActor->pPlayer->RoomId, pDnodeActor, pDnode2, GiveMsg);
```

This causes the message to be sent to everyone in the room, except the originating player and the target player.

SendToRoom variation 2

In DoDrop the player receives a message and everyone else in the room receives a variation of the message. Only the origination player should not get a message from the SendToRoom function, so the following code is used:

```cpp
SendToRoom(pDnodeActor->pPlayer->RoomId, pDnodeActor, pDnodeActor, DropMsg);
```

This causes the message to be sent to everyone in the room, except the originating player.

SendToRoom variation 3

In DoHail everyone in the room should receive the message when an NPC responds to a 'hail', so the following code is used:

```cpp
SendToRoom(RoomId, NULL, NULL, MobileMsg);
```

This causes the message to be sent to everyone in the room.

## 5 Fighting

In keeping with the persistent world theme, all information concerning fights is kept in external text files. This results in a somewhat complex set of directories, files, and the relationships between them. The directories and files used to track all fights are found in the /Running/Fight directory. When a fight begins, any player involved is placed in the FIGHTING state. A player cannot 'do' certain things while in the FIGHTING state. For example, 'sleeping' is not allowed while fighting. Players cannot fight each other, so only mobile/player fights need to be tracked. A player can attack only one mobile at a time and a mobile can attack only one player at a time. Players and mobiles always automatically attack whomever or whatever attacked them unless they are already in a fight with someone or something else. A player or mobile cannot switch targets during a fight, the fight is to the death or until the player or mobile flee the scene.

### 5.1 Directories

Fights range from simple, such as Zed attacks small rat and small rat fights back, to complex, such as:

> Zed attacks small rat

> Small rat fights back and begins biting Zed

> Zeke attacks small rat

> Large rat goes aggro on Zeke and starts biting him

In a room with several players and several mobiles, things can get complicated. Three directories are used to track who is fighting whom.

> MobPlayer        tracks which player a mobile is attacking

> MobStats        contains 'fight stats' copied from \Library\Mobiles

> PlayerMob        tracks which mobile a player is attacking

### 5.2 Files

Files, in the above-mentioned directories, are created when a fight begins and are deleted when the fight ends. Directories 'MobPlayer' and 'PlayerMob' both contain files which are named using the player's name, like Zed.txt. The existence of a file in one of these directories corresponds directly with the player being in the FIGHTING state.

The MobStats directory contains one file for each mobile engage in a fight. The statistics, copied from \Library\Mobiles, include: (see Admin document for explanations of these)

> HitPoints    decremented each time the mobile is damaged

> Armor        used to calculate damage done by a player

> Attack        determines fight message contents

> Damage        used to calculate damage done to a player

> ExpPoints    experience awarded to a player when the mobile dies

### 5.3 Pseudo Code

This is the pseudo code for specific events during the life of a fight. The 'fight code' processes the information found in the /Fight directory once during each player's turn, if the player is in the FIGHTING state. This is pseudo code describes the events that start and stop a fight. The names of mobiles and players in these examples are made up and may or may not exist in the /Players and /Library/Mobiles directories. These are only three sample cases; there are more possibilities.

Case 1 - Zed issues the kill command, as in 'kill rat'

Search room for a rat and select the first rat found, i.e. smallrat

Remove rat from room

Assign rat the next mobile number

(use \Running\Control\NextMobileNumber.txt)

Create \Running\Fight\PlayerMob\Zed.txt

```cpp
        containing one line -> SmallRat.7
```

Create \Running\Fight\MobPlayer\Zed.txt

```cpp
        containing one line -> SmallRat.7
```

Create \Running\Fight\MobStats\SmallRat.7.txt

```cpp
    containing the following lines,
    copied from \Library\Mobiles\SmallRat.txt,
```

HitPoints: 5

Armor:     1

Attack:    Bite

Damage:    5

ExpPoints: 25

> Now the fight code will use these files to cause Zed and the small rat to whack each other.

Case 2 - Zeke is exploring the forest and a black wolf attacks without provocation. This code required in this situation is same as case 1, except the names are changed and the fight is started automatically due to the player entering a room containing an 'aggro' mobile.

Select which player the wolf is to attack, in this case, Zeke

Remove wolf from room

Assign wolf the next mobile number

(use /Running/Control/NextMobileNumber.txt)

Create /Running/Fight/PlayerMob/Zeke.txt

```cpp
        containing one line -> BlackWolf.101
```

Create /Running/Fight/MobPlayer/Zeke.txt

```cpp
        containing one line -> BlackWolf.101
```

Create /Running/Fight/MobStats/BlackWolf.101.txt

```cpp
    containing the following lines,
    copied from /Library/Mobiles/BlackWolf.txt,
```

HitPoints: 25

Armor:     10

Attack:    Bite

Damage:    25

ExpPoints: 100

Now the fight code will use these files to cause Zeke and the black wolf to whack each other.

Case 3 - Zeke is lost in the desert and they stumble upon a den of vipers. The vipers are aggro and they attack Zeke. Assume that there are two vipers.

```cpp
    Select a target for each viper (let's say Zeke)
    Remove the vipers from the room
```

Assign each viper a number (let's use 98 and 99)

Create /Running/Fight/PlayerMob/Zeke.txt

```cpp
        containing one line -> Viper.98
```

Create /Running/Fight/MobPlayer/Zeke.txt

```cpp
        containing one line -> Viper.98
```

Create /Running/Fight/MobPlayer/Zeke.txt

```cpp
        containing one line -> Viper.99
```

Create /Running/Fight/MobStats/Viper.98.txt

and create /Running/Fight/MobStats/Viper.99.txt

```cpp
    both containing the following lines,
    copied from /Library/Mobiles/Viper.txt,
```

HitPoints: 50

Armor:     10

Attack:    Bite

Damage:    50

ExpPoints: 125

Now the fight code will use these files to cause Zeke to whack viper.98 and both viper.98 and viper.99 to whack Zeke.

## 6 Armor Class

See admin.doc section of the same name for additional information concerning armor class.

### 6.1 Definitions

The Player's Armor Class (PAC) Armor class is the sum of the 'armor value' of all objects worn by the player. Maximum Armor Class (MAC) and Maximum Damage Reduction Percent (MDRP) are specified in Config.h and used in BigDog.cpp to calculate the Player Armor Class Magic Number (PACMN). When the PACMN is multiplied the player's armor class, the result is the Damage Reduction Percent (DRP). This bit of algebraic manipulation reduces the number calculations required during each fight iteration.

PACMN calculation:

MAC     = 300

MDRP     = 60

PACMN = 1 / MAC * MDRP / 100

PACMN = 1 / 300 * 60 / 100 = .002

### 6.2 Damage To Player

The damage taken by the player (DTP) during a fight is calculated as follows:

> DTP = floor(Damage - (PAC * PACMN * Damage) )

## 7 How To Add A New Command

This section describes the tasks and the proper sequence required to add a new command to OMugs. Following this procedure should minimize the risk of disruption to the players.

### 7.1 Command Design

Decide what the command is going to 'do'. This may seem obvious, but it is important the think through what effect the command is going to have and how will that effect be accomplished. For example, the 'get' command takes an item from the room and places in the player's inventory. How is that accomplished?

All commands result in some text being sent to the player. Here are some questions you should consider:

What is going to be sent to the player issuing the command?

Does the command have a target player? If so, what do they see?

What do other players in the room see?

What do all players logged on see?

This table shows the possible message relationships between the player issuing the command and the rest of the players.

| Command | Player | Target | Others in Room | Others not in room |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| who | Y | N | N | N |
| tell | Y | Y | N | N |
| give | Y | Y | Y | N |
| say | Y | N | Y | N |
| ooc | Y | Y | Y | Y |

### 7.2 Command Table

Add the command, in alphabetical order, to the command table. This table is a text file called 'ValidCommands.txt' in the '/Running/Control/' directory. Set the authorization for the command to 'admin' like the 'advance' command. This will allow you to test the command without affecting the players. When ready to release the command the players, just change 'admin' to 'all' or a number, indicating the level the player must be before using this command. Of course, if this is an administrator’s only command, no further changes are required.

### 7.3 Define Function

For the purposes of this discussion assume you're implementing the 'eat' command. All command functions are named 'Do<Command>' where <Command> is the command used by the player with only the first letter capitalized. So, the function name is DoEat.

Add the function definition to Communication.h by finding the other commands and inserting DoEat in alphabetical order. All command functions are passed *pDnodeActor. Only pass CmdStr if the command does not expect or care if the player typed anything after the command (see afk command).

```cpp
    void    static  DoDrop(Dnode *pDnodeActor, CString CmdStr);
    void    static  DoEat(Dnode *pDnodeActor, CString CmdStr);
    void    static  DoEmote(Dnode *pDnodeActor, CString CmdStr);
```

Add the DoEat function to Communication.cpp in alphabetical order, right after the DoDrop function.

```cpp
/***********************************************************
 * Eat command                                             *
 ***********************************************************/

void Communication::DoEat(Dnode *pDnodeActor, CString CmdStr)
{
}
```

Now you should be able to compile OMugs without any errors. This is a good practice because this confirms that the compiler is happy with your changes so far and an unhappy compiler is a bad thing. If you fire up OMugs, logon, and type 'eat' you will get a message produced by the CommandParse function saying that the command is not available.

### 7.4 Command Parsing

The CommandParse function finds the next new line in pDnodeActor->PlayerInp and assigns that string to CmdStr and removes that string from pDnodeActor->PlayerInp. For example, if pDnodeActor->PlayerInp contained the following:

'eat apple\nsay Yummy\n'

that would mean the player had typed 'eat apple' and then 'say Yummy' before the eat command was processed. CommandParse would assign 'eat apple' to CmdStr and remove 'eat apple\n' from pDnodeActor->PlayerInp leaving 'say Yummy\n' to be parsed later.

After validating the command and making sure it is not a 'social', CommandParse calls the appropriate function. The code is simple, just add the following in alphabetical order:

```cpp
  /* EAT command */
  if (MudCmd == "eat")
  {
    DoEat(pDnodeActor, CmdStr);
    return;
  }
```

Compile OMugs and test the eat command. You should not get any messages this time, in fact you don't even get a prompt. Each time a player enters a command, they expect something to happen and they expect to get a message of some sort and a prompt.

### 7.5 Message and Prompt

The 'eat' command should send a message to the player and all players in the room. Something like:

Ixaka sees:                         You take a big bite from a red apple.

Players in the room see:     Ixaka takes a big bite from a red apple.

This test code will send a message to the player and a prompt. Add the code to the DoEat function, compile, and test.

```cpp
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "The eat command is not ready, starve!";
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "\r\n";
  pDnodeActor->pPlayer->CreatePrompt();
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pDnodeActor->pPlayer->GetOutput();
```

### 7.6 Do Something

So far the new 'eat' command doesn't do very much. It only sends a message and a prompt. But, DoEat has a firm foundation upon which the rest of the function can be built. DoEat needs code that will actually do something, like modify the player's hunger level and remove the item eaten from their inventory. Most commands require some validation before they do something, AFK is an example of an exception.

Some of the more common validation checks are command syntax, command parameters, and player position. Eat is very similar to DoDrop command, so you can copy the parts needed from the DoDrop function. Be sure to remove the 'test' code first. In the validation code, the player position, command syntax, object existence, and object type are checked.

```cpp
  //********************
  //* Validate command *
  //********************
  if (IsSleeping(pDnodeActor))
  { // Player is sleeping, send msg, command is not done
    return;
  }
  if (WordCount(CmdStr) == 1)
  { // Invalid command format
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "Eat what?";
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "\r\n";
    pDnodeActor->pPlayer->CreatePrompt();
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pDnodeActor->pPlayer->GetOutput();
    return;
  }
  //****************************
  //* Does player have object? *
  //****************************
  TmpStr = GetWord(CmdStr, 2);
  ObjectName = TmpStr;
  TmpStr.MakeLower();
  pObject = IsObjInPlayerInv(pDnodeActor, TmpStr);
  if (!pObject)
  {
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "You don't have a(n) ";
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += ObjectName;
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += " in your inventory.\r\n";
    pDnodeActor->pPlayer->CreatePrompt();
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pDnodeActor->pPlayer->GetOutput();
    return;
  }
  //*******************
  //* Is object food? *
  //*******************
  pObject->Type.MakeLower();
  if (pObject->Type != "food")
  {
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "You can't eat ";
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pObject->Desc1;
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += ".";
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "\r\n";
    pDnodeActor->pPlayer->CreatePrompt();
    pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pDnodeActor->pPlayer->GetOutput();
    return;
  }
```

After all the validation is completed, you know that the player’s position is Ok and that the command, object, and object type are all valid. Now, we finally get to do something, like effect the player's hunger level,  remove the item from the player's inventory, and send messages to the player and all players in the room.

```cpp
  //**************
  //* Eat object *
  //**************
  // Send messages
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "You eat ";
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pObject->Desc1;
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += ".";
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += "\r\n";
  EatMsg  = pDnodeActor->PlayerName;
  EatMsg += " eats ";
  EatMsg += pObject->Desc1;
  EatMsg += ".";
  SendToRoom(pDnodeActor->pPlayer->RoomId, pDnodeActor, pDnodeActor, EatMsg);
  // Eat and remove object from player's inventory
  pDnodeActor->pPlayer->Eat(pDnodeActor, pObject->FoodPct);
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pDnodeActor->pPlayer->GetOutput();
  Object::RemoveObjFromPlayerInv(pDnodeActor, pObject->ObjectId, 1);
  // Clean up and give prompt
  delete pObject;
  pDnodeActor->pPlayer->CreatePrompt();
  pDnodeActor->PlayerOut += pDnodeActor->pPlayer->GetOutput();
```

Player::Eat is a new function that must be added to the Player class to actually change the player's hunger level. Exploration and understanding of that function is left as an exercise for the reader.

## 8 Osi - OMugs Script Interpreter

Osi allows the game developer to enhance the virtual world by adding triggers to rooms and NPCs. For example, when a player gives an NPC a particular object, the NPC could give the player a special object in return.

### 8.1 Major Components

Osi is a recursive descendant parser containing a front end to interpret the script source code and a back end to execute the translated script. The Osi claseses are Buffer, Scanner, Token, Parser, Symbol, Icode, Executor, and RunStack. Each time a player enters a room or hails an NPC, Osi is called and check for the existance of a script file for that room or NPC. If no script is found, Osi exits. The Buffer, Scanner, Token, Parser, and Symbol classes make up the front end. The Icode class is common to the front end and back end. The Executor and RunStack classes make up the back end.

### 8.2 Front End

In the Osi front end, the classes are created as follows:

Osi creates Parser

```cpp
  pParser     = new Parser(ScriptFileName);
```

The Parser creates Scanner, Token , Symbol, and Icode

```cpp
  pScanner    = new Scanner(ScriptFileName);
  pToken      = new Token;
  pSymbolRoot = new Symbol("");
  pIcode      = new Icode;
```

The Scanner creates the Buffer

```cpp
  pBuffer     = new Buffer(ScriptFileName);
```

After initialization, ch points to the first character in the script file, thereby 'the pump is primed'. Then Parser calls Scanner which determines the type of token to be parsed. Scanner calls Token which in turn calls Buffer to read the script file. As the Parser acquires the information needed, it builds Symbol and Icode. Below is a diagram showing the flow of data from the script file to Icode.

```cpp
                                        Symbol
                                          |
Script -> Buffer -> Token -> Scanner -> Parser -> Icode
```

### 8.3 Back End

In the Osi back end, the classes are created as follows:

Osi creates Executor

```cpp
pExecutor = new Executor(pSymbolRoot, pIcode);
```

The Executor creates RunStack

```cpp
pRunStack = new RunStack;
```

The Executor reads and executes the Icode using Symbol to store values and RunStack to store intermediate results.
